# 👋 Hey, I'm Akaash

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm a developer who enjoys crafting clean and responsive frontends, with an interest in diving more into full-stack development.

## 🚀 What I'm Working On

I'm currently working on a full-stack project for one of my classes. I'm serving as the assistant lead for frontend, using **React** alongside **Tailwind CSS**.  
The backend uses **Express**, **Node.js**, **Prisma ORM**, and **PostgreSQL** — so I'm getting solid experience across the stack.

## 🛠️ Tech I Use & Like

- 🌐 Frontend: React, Tailwind CSS, Laravel
- ⚙️ Backend: Node.js, Express, Prisma, PostgreSQL
- 📚 Currently learning: React + Tailwind (and loving the workflow)

## 🔧 Fun Fact

I'm big into thrifting electronics — there's nothing better than getting a good deal!
