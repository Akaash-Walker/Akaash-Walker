# Hello there! ðŸ‘‹ 

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm Akaash, a Junior CS student at WPI.

## ðŸš€ What I'm Working On

I'm currently working on a full-stack project for one of my classes. I'm serving as assistant lead for frontend development, using **React** alongside **Tailwind CSS**.  
The backend uses **Express**, **Node.js**, **Prisma ORM**, and **PostgreSQL**.

## ðŸ”§ Fun Fact

I like to buy (almost) all my electronics second hand!
